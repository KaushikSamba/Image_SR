IMAGE SUPER-RESOLUTION USING CNNs (In Dev)

The repository contains the following content

1> Data_Cifar - Contains the dataset used for training and Testing the model.
2> extract_imgs.py - The code for extracting the images from the dataset and convertin it into a 4D tensor.
3> SR_CNN.py - Containg the code for the CNN model used. Run program for training the model on the Cifar dataset.
4> model_test.py - The code for testing the network. Run program once the training is complete. 

Dependencies required:
1> Tensorflow
2> numpy
3> OpenCV
4> Scipy

The codes are based on the paper: "Image Super-Resolution Using Deep Convolutional Networks" by Chao Dong, Chen Change Loy, Kaiming He and Xiaoou Tang.
